# Let it be. let's start the documentation for the whole project. I ran docker-compose up --build first to download all dependencies but later I only do docker-compose up.

Absolutely! Here’s a **clear, professional README.md** template for your project, tailored to your setup and workflow. You can copy this to your project root as `README.md` and adjust details as you like.

# Deep Art: Neural Style Transfer Web App

Deep Art is a full-stack, containerized web application for neural style transfer. Users can upload an image, pick from a set of artistic styles, and instantly generate a stylized version using deep learning—all from a modern browser interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Modern React frontend** with live image preview and style thumbnails
- **Fast neural style transfer** powered by PyTorch and Flask
- **Fully Dockerized**: easy to run, no local Python/Node setup required
- **Download stylized images** directly from the browser
- **Extensible**: add new styles or models easily

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running

---

### **Quick Start**

1. **Clone the repository:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Gamikant/deep-art.git
cd deep-art
```

2. **Build and start all services:**
    - First time (downloads/builds everything):

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

    - Next time (just starts containers):

```sh
docker-compose up
```

3. **Open your browser and go to:**

```
http://localhost:3000
```

4. **Use the app:**
    - Upload your image
    - Select a style from the thumbnails
    - Click **Stylize!**
    - Download your stylized image

## ⚙️ Configuration \& Customization

- **Add new styles:**
    - Place new pre-trained PyTorch `.pth` models in `backend/models/`
    - Add the style to both `backend/app.py` (`STYLE_MODELS` dict) and `frontend/src/styles.js`
    - Add a thumbnail image to `frontend/public/styles/`
- **Change ports:**
Edit `docker-compose.yml` if you want to use different ports.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Development Tips

- **Live reload:**
Both frontend and backend use volume mounts for instant code reloading.
- **Logs:**
    - Backend logs show in your terminal where you ran `docker-compose up`.
    - Frontend logs/errors show in your browser console.

---

## 🐳 Docker Commands

- **Build and start (first time):**

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

- **Start after first build:**

```sh
docker-compose up
```

- **Stop all services:**

```sh
docker-compose down
```

- **Rebuild a single service:**

```sh
docker-compose up --build frontend
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: I get an error when clicking Stylize!**
A: Make sure both containers are running. Check the backend logs for errors.

**Q: How do I add my own style?**
A: Add your `.pth` model to `backend/models/`, update the style list in both frontend and backend, and add a thumbnail.

**Q: Can I run this without Docker?**
A: Yes, but you must install Python, Node.js, and all dependencies manually.
